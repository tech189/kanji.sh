            <div>
                <TextLogo /> aims to become a free & more comfortable way to study kanji reading and
                writing. Right now, there are hundreds of free resources available online but filled
                with distracting advertisements. I personally feel that distracting, not letting you
                focus on the reading. So, I&apos;m making this website for myself and others who
                want to want to study kanji distraction-free. For now, there are hundreds of
                worksheets for download and practice writing. Why write kanji rather than using an
                app to dribble? Here are{' '}

            <h5>Buy me Sushi</h5>
            <div>
                I work on <TextLogo /> in my free time, and it took me a considerable amount of time
                to build up to this point. You can fuel <TextLogo /> by buying me some Sushi. It
                also covers costs for servers, domain, and keeps me motivated to put more time to
                improve <TextLogo />.
